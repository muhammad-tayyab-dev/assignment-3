       <p>FDA regulates products that we think of as “makeup” –such as lipstick, blush, foundation, face powder, eye shadow eye liner, and mascara--as cosmetics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. 

        The law does not require cosmetic products and ingredients (except for color additives not intended as coal-tar hair dyes) to have FDA approval before they go on the market, but it does require them to be safe when consumers use them according to their labeling, or as they are customarily used. Also, any color additives used in cosmetics must be approved by FDA. 
        
        Some makeup is labeled with sunscreen claims, such as “SPF” numbers. Sunscreen products intended to protect consumers from the sun are regulated as drugs. Products intended both as makeup and sun protection are both cosmetics and drugs. To learn more, see “Sunscreens.” If you have questions about sunscreen products, contact FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, at druginfo@fda.hhs.gov. To learn about sunscreen ingredients intended to protect the product from problems such as fading, see the regulation, “Cosmetics containing sunscreen ingredients” (21 CFR 700.35). </p>

        <p>CFSAN is aware of adverse events, such as hair loss, hair breakage, balding, itching and rash reported to occur with the use of hair cleansing products based on reports submitted to the CFSAN Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS). Reported products include shampoos, conditioners, and cleansing conditioners, often referred to as “shampoo alternatives,” which are marketed as being free of detergents and foaming agents.

            The FDA first became aware of adverse health effects associated with the use of cleansing conditioners in 2016, after receiving nearly 1,400 adverse reports that year alone. The FDA has not been able to determine the cause of these reported reactions because we do not have enough information. 
            
            The FDA regulates cosmetics, including cleansing conditioners, under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. Under these laws, cosmetic products and ingredients, with the exception of color additives, are not approved by the FDA before they go on the market, and cosmetic companies are not required to share their safety data or consumer complaints with the FDA. However, cosmetics must be properly labeled and must not be adulterated. For example, they must be safe under the labeled or customary conditions of use. Companies and individuals who manufacture or market cosmetics are responsible for the safety and labeling of their products and ingredients. The FDA can take action against cosmetics on the market that do not comply with the law. To learn more, see FDA Authority Over Cosmetics. 
            
            While the FDA is investigating the mechanisms and possible ingredients that may be causing these adverse events, we encourage physicians and other health care providers to submit an adverse event report to the FDA if they have patients who have experienced such problems. Additionally, consumers who experience problems such as hair loss, balding, itching, rash or other reactions, as a result of using one of these products, should stop using the product immediately and contact their health care provider. Then, inform FDA about the incident as soon as possible.
            
            You can report a reaction online or by phone:
            
            Contact the FDA’s MedWatch reporting system, either online or by phone at 1-800-332-1088.
            Contact your nearest FDA district office consumer complaint coordinator.
            When you report your problem to the FDA, please provide as much detail as possible about the specific product you used and your reaction. More information about these products and the reported problems can help us in our investigation to determine the cause and what actions we can take under the laws we enforce to protect and promote public health.</p>

      <p>Nail products for both home and salon use are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), these products are generally regulated as cosmetics [FD&C Act, section 201(i)].

      Nail products intended to treat medical problems, such as nail fungus, are drugs. The information on this page is about nail products that are cosmetics. To learn more about the differences between cosmetics and drugs, see “Is It a Cosmetic, a Drug, or Both? (Or Is It Soap?)".
                
       By law, nail products sold in the United States must be safe for consumers  when used according to directions on the label, or in the usual or customary way (see Key Legal Concepts: Interstate Commerce, Adulteration and Misbranding). Many nail products contain potentially harmful ingredients, but are allowed on the market because they are safe when used as directed. For example, some nail ingredients are harmful when swallowed, but not when used on the nails, because the nail is a barrier, which prevents absorption.</p>

         <p>Lotions, soaps, and other cleansers may be regulated as cosmetics or as other product categories, depending on how they are intended to be used.

         Cleansing products, many of which are marketed as “soap,” may be cosmetics or drugs regulated by FDA, or consumer products regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, depending on how they are made or how they are intended to be used. For example, soaps and cleansers marketed as “antibacterial” are drugs.
                    
         Lotions intended to make people more attractive are cosmetics. But, if they’re intended to affect the structure or function of the body, or for a therapeutic purpose, such as treating or preventing disease, they’re drugs, or sometimes they may be both cosmetics and drugs. For example, sunscreen products are drugs under U.S. law. So are skin protectants, skin bleaches, and treatments for skin conditions such as acne, eczema, or rosacea.
                    
          Some lotions are both cosmetics and drugs, and must meet the requirements for both categories. Lotions that are intended both to moisturize the skin and protect users from the sun are just one example.  To learn more about the differences, see “Is It a Cosmetic, a Drug, or Both? (Or Is It Soap?).”
                    
         The resources below provide safety and regulatory information about soaps and lotions.</p>

            <p>Wipes intended for cleansing or moisturizing the skin, such as those for baby care, hand washing, makeup removal, washing the body when bathing is not practical, or feminine or other personal cleansing, are regulated as cosmetics. So are wipes intended for applying products such as sunless tanners or deodorants.
         The law doesn’t require cosmetic products or ingredients, other than color additives, to have FDA approval before they go on the market.
                        
         But cosmetics must be safe when people use them as directed on the label, or in the customary or usual way. To learn more, see “FDA Authority Over Cosmetics.”
                        
          Wipes intended for a therapeutic purpose, such as killing germs on the skin, or treating acne, diaper rash, or other skin conditions, are drugs under the law. Drugs must meet requirements for FDA approval for safety and effectiveness before they go on the market. Drugs are regulated by FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
          Wipes intended to control germs on inanimate surfaces (disinfect or sanitize) and wipes containing  insect repellents are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency.
         Wipes intended for cleansing objects in our homes, at work, the gym, and in public places are regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
